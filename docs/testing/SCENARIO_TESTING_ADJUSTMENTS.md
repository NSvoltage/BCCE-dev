# BCCE Scenario Testing Adjustments

## Issues Identified During Real-World Testing

### Performance Issue: Slow Initialization
**Problem**: Commands taking 30+ seconds due to AWS service initialization in constructors
**Impact**: Poor developer experience in real-world usage
**Root Cause**: All AWS services initializing on startup even when not needed

### Solution: Lazy Loading Implementation

#### Current Issue
```typescript
// This runs on every CLI command, even for help
constructor() {
  super();
  this.initializeIAM(); // Slow
  this.createDefaultPermissionSets(); // Slow  
  this.createDefaultRoles(); // Slow
}
```

#### Recommended Fix
```typescript
// Initialize only when actually needed
constructor() {
  super();
  // Remove initialization from constructor
}

private async ensureInitialized() {
  if (!this.initialized) {
    await this.initializeIAM();
    this.initialized = true;
  }
}
```

## Testing Results Summary

### What Works Perfectly âœ…

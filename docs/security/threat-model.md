# BCCE Security Threat Model

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive threat model for BCCE (Bedrock Claude Code Enablement Kit) to guide security implementation and risk management in enterprise environments.

**Risk Assessment**: MODERATE to HIGH risk due to code generation capabilities and AWS resource access.

## System Overview

### Components in Scope
- BCCE CLI (Node.js/TypeScript)
- Workflow execution engine
- AWS Bedrock integration
- Agent policy enforcement
- Artifact storage system
- Authentication mechanisms (Identity Center/Cognito)

### Trust Boundaries
1. **Developer Workstation** ↔ BCCE CLI
2. **BCCE CLI** ↔ AWS Bedrock
3. **BCCE Workflows** ↔ Local Filesystem
4. **Artifact Storage** ↔ External Access
5. **Enterprise Network** ↔ Internet

## Threat Analysis

### T1: Code Injection and Execution

#### T1.1 Malicious Workflow Injection
**Threat**: Attacker injects malicious workflows to execute arbitrary code

**Attack Vectors**:
- Compromised workflow files in source control
- Social engineering to run malicious workflows
- Supply chain attack through workflow templates

**Impact**: HIGH - Arbitrary code execution on developer machines
- Data exfiltration from development environments
- Credential theft from local AWS profiles
- Lateral movement through corporate networks

**Mitigations**:
```yaml
# Workflow signing and verification
workflow_security:
  signature_required: true
  trusted_publishers_only: true
  schema_validation: strict

# Command allowlist enforcement  
agent_policies:
  cmd_allowlist: ["npm", "node", "jest"]  # Explicit allowlist
  bash_disabled: true                      # Never allow bash
  shell_operators_blocked: true           # No pipes, redirects
```

**Detection**:

2. Enable comprehensive audit logging to CloudWatch
3. Deploy network segmentation for BCCE workloads
4. Configure automated vulnerability scanning

### Short-term (30-90 days)  
1. Implement behavioral anomaly detection
2. Deploy container security scanning
3. Establish security incident response procedures
4. Conduct security awareness training

### Long-term (90+ days)
1. Complete SOC2 Type II audit preparation
2. Implement zero-trust network architecture
3. Deploy advanced threat hunting capabilities
4. Establish continuous security monitoring

This threat model should be reviewed quarterly and updated as new threats emerge or system capabilities change.

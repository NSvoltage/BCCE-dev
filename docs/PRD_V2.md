# BCCE Product Requirements Document v2.0

**Enterprise Governance Layer for AI Workflows**

---

## Product Vision

**BCCE is the AWS-native enterprise governance layer that makes any AI workflow engine ready for Fortune 500 deployment.**

BCCE provides the policy enforcement, compliance logging, cost intelligence, and enterprise integration that organizations need to deploy AI workflows at scale - regardless of whether they use Claude Code, Shopify Roast, or custom solutions.

## Strategic Positioning

### Market Analysis

| Solution | Strength | Enterprise Gap | BCCE Positioning |
|----------|----------|----------------|------------------|
| **Claude Code** | AI-native workflows, GitHub integration | Limited enterprise governance | ✅ Governance layer |
| **Shopify Roast** | Elegant workflow orchestration | No AWS/enterprise focus | ✅ AWS integration |
| **GitHub Actions** | CI/CD integration | No AI-specific governance | ✅ AI workflow governance |

### Value Proposition

**"Transform any AI workflow engine into an enterprise-ready solution with AWS-native governance, compliance, and observability."**

**Not**: Another workflow engine competing with existing solutions  
**But**: The essential enterprise infrastructure layer that AWS is uniquely positioned to provide

## Core Requirements

### 1. Workflow Engine Governance Adapter

**Problem**: Existing workflow engines lack enterprise governance capabilities

**Solution**: Pluggable governance layer that works with any workflow engine

```typescript
interface WorkflowGovernanceAdapter {
  engine: 'claude_code' | 'roast' | 'github_actions' | 'custom';
  
  governance: {
    policyEnforcement: PolicyEngine;
    approvalWorkflows: ApprovalOrchestrator;
    complianceLogging: AuditLogger;
    costControls: BudgetEnforcer;
  };
  
  // Execute workflow with enterprise governance
  execute(workflow: Workflow): Promise<GovernedExecution>;
}
```

**Implementation**:
- **Policy Engine**: AWS Config rules for governance compliance
- **Approval Orchestrator**: AWS Step Functions for multi-stage approvals
- **Audit Logger**: Comprehensive session recording with S3/encryption
- **Budget Enforcer**: AWS Budgets integration with automatic throttling

### 2. Enterprise Policy Management

**Problem**: Organizations need centralized policy control across all AI workflows

**Solution**: AWS Organizations-integrated policy management

```yaml
# Enterprise policy definition
enterprise_policies:
  security:
    sensitive_data_blocking: true
    security_review_required: true
    approved_models: ["claude-3-5-sonnet", "claude-3-haiku"]
    max_context_size: 200000
  
  cost:
    monthly_budget_per_user: 500.00
    cost_alerts: [50, 80, 100]  # percentage thresholds
    auto_throttle_threshold: 120
    
  compliance:
    session_recording: "full"
    audit_retention_days: 2555  # 7 years
    data_residency: ["us-east-1", "us-west-2"]
    encryption_required: true
    
  approval:
    security_findings: "security_team"
    cost_overruns: "finance_team"
    compliance_violations: "compliance_officer"
```

**AWS Services Used**:
- **Organizations**: Cross-account policy enforcement
- **Config**: Compliance monitoring and enforcement
- **IAM**: Role-based access control
- **Secrets Manager**: Secure policy configuration

### 3. Advanced Cost Intelligence

**Problem**: Organizations need sophisticated cost management beyond basic tracking

**Solution**: AWS-native cost optimization with predictive analytics

```typescript
interface EnterpriseCostIntelligence {
  attribution: {
    byProject: string;
    byTeam: string;
    byWorkflow: string;
    chargebackCodes: string[];
  };
  
  optimization: {
    modelRecommendations: boolean;  // Suggest Haiku for simple tasks
    workflowEfficiency: boolean;    // Identify cost-ineffective patterns
    budgetForecasting: boolean;     // Predict monthly spending
    anomalyDetection: boolean;      // Alert on unusual spending
  };
  
  integration: {
    awsBudgets: boolean;           // Automated budget management
    costExplorer: boolean;         // Historical analysis
    billingAlerts: boolean;        // Real-time notifications
  };
}
```

**Features**:
- **Smart Model Routing**: Automatically route simple tasks to cheaper models
- **Workflow Cost Analysis**: Identify expensive vs. efficient workflow patterns
- **Predictive Budgeting**: Forecast costs based on usage trends
- **Automated Throttling**: Prevent budget overruns with automatic controls

### 4. Compliance-Grade Observability

**Problem**: Regulated industries need complete audit trails for AI interactions

**Solution**: Comprehensive session recording and compliance reporting

```typescript
interface ComplianceObservability {
  sessionRecording: {
    fullConversationCapture: boolean;
    codeChangesTracking: boolean;
    decisionRationale: boolean;
    approvalWorkflow: boolean;
  };
  
  storage: {
    s3Encryption: string;          // KMS customer-managed keys
    crossRegionReplication: boolean;
    immutableStorage: boolean;     // Object Lock for compliance
    retentionPolicy: number;       // Configurable retention
  };
  
  search: {
    fullTextSearch: boolean;       // OpenSearch integration
    metadataFiltering: boolean;
    complianceQueries: boolean;
    exportCapabilities: boolean;
  };
  
  reporting: {
    regulatoryFrameworks: string[]; // SOC2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS
    automatedReports: boolean;
    executiveSummaries: boolean;
    auditPreparation: boolean;
  };
}
```

**AWS Services Used**:
- **S3**: Encrypted storage with Object Lock
- **OpenSearch**: Searchable audit logs
- **Kinesis**: Real-time log streaming
- **QuickSight**: Executive reporting dashboards

### 5. Enterprise Integration Ecosystem

**Problem**: AI workflows need to integrate with existing enterprise systems

**Solution**: EventBridge-powered integration platform

```typescript
interface EnterpriseIntegrations {
  communication: {
    slack: SlackIntegration;       // /bcce commands, notifications
    teams: TeamsIntegration;       // Workflow triggers, updates
    email: EmailNotifications;    // Executive summaries, alerts
  };
  
  projectManagement: {
    jira: JiraIntegration;         // Ticket creation, status updates
    serviceNow: ServiceNowIntegration; // Incident response, change requests
    azureDevOps: AzureDevOpsIntegration; // Work item integration
  };
  
  security: {
    okta: OktaIntegration;         // SSO, role-based access
    splunk: SplunkIntegration;     // Security event correlation
    crowdstrike: CrowdStrikeIntegration; // Threat intelligence
  };
  
  business: {
    salesforce: SalesforceIntegration; // Customer context
    workday: WorkdayIntegration;   // HR integration for team data
    tableau: TableauIntegration;   // Business intelligence
  };
}
```

**Integration Architecture**:
- **EventBridge**: Central event routing

  ): Promise<GovernedResult>;
  
  // Standard interface for all engines
  validate(workflow: Workflow): Promise<ValidationResult>;
  resume(workflowId: string, step: string): Promise<ResumeResult>;
  abort(workflowId: string, reason: string): Promise<AbortResult>;
}
```

#### Cost Intelligence Engine
```typescript
class CostIntelligenceEngine {
  async optimizeWorkflow(workflow: Workflow): Promise<CostOptimization> {
    // Analyze workflow complexity
    const complexity = await this.analyzeComplexity(workflow);
    
    // Recommend optimal models
    const modelRecommendations = await this.recommendModels(complexity);
    
    // Estimate costs
    const costEstimate = await this.estimateCosts(workflow, modelRecommendations);
    
    return { complexity, modelRecommendations, costEstimate };
  }
}
```

# Security Policy

BCCE (Bedrock Claude Code Enablement Kit) takes security seriously. This document outlines our security practices, reporting procedures, and commitment to maintaining a secure platform for enterprise users.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Philosophy

BCCE is designed with **security by default** principles:
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Never trust, always verify
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Least Privilege Access**: Minimal permissions required
- **Security as Code**: Automated security controls and compliance

## üîí Security Features

### Data Protection
- **Encryption in Transit**: All data transmitted using TLS 1.3
- **Encryption at Rest**: AWS KMS encryption for all stored data
- **Data Residency**: Configurable data location controls
- **PII Protection**: Automatic detection and protection of sensitive data

### Access Control
- **IAM Integration**: Native AWS IAM role-based access control
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: MFA enforcement for all administrative operations
- **Temporary Credentials**: Short-lived, automatically rotating credentials
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail of all operations

### Infrastructure Security
- **VPC Isolation**: Network-level isolation using AWS VPC
- **Private Subnets**: Application components in private networks
- **Security Groups**: Granular network access controls
- **WAF Protection**: Web Application Firewall for API endpoints

## üìã Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          | Security Updates |
| ------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| 1.x.x   | ‚úÖ Active Support  | Regular updates  |
| 0.9.x   | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited Support | Critical only    |
| < 0.9   | ‚ùå No Support      | Not supported    |

**Recommendation**: Always use the latest stable version for the best security posture.

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate the security community's efforts in identifying and reporting security issues. Please follow these guidelines:

**DO:**
- Report vulnerabilities privately to security@bcce.dev
- Provide detailed reproduction steps
- Allow reasonable time for investigation and patching
- Work with us to verify fixes before public disclosure

**DON'T:**
- Create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
- Exploit vulnerabilities beyond proof-of-concept
- Access or modify data that doesn't belong to you
- Perform denial-of-service attacks

### Reporting Process

## üîê Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Installation Security
```bash
# Verify package signatures
npm audit bcce
bcce doctor --security-check

# Use official sources only
npm install -g bcce  # Official NPM
# Download from GitHub releases with checksum verification
```

#### Configuration Security
```yaml
# bcce.config.yaml - Secure configuration example
version: "1.0"
security:
  encryption:
    enabled: true
    kms_key_id: "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"
  
  access_control:
    mfa_required: true
    session_timeout: 3600
    
  audit:
    enabled: true
    log_level: "INFO"
    retention_days: 90
```

#### Credential Management
```bash
# Use AWS profiles (recommended)
aws configure --profile bcce-prod
bcce deploy --profile bcce-prod

# Environment variables (for CI/CD)
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA...
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=...  # For temporary credentials
```

### For Administrators

#### Network Security
- Deploy in private subnets
- Use VPC endpoints for AWS services
- Implement network monitoring
- Configure security groups restrictively

#### IAM Configuration
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT:role/BCCEExecutionRole"
      },
      "Action": [
        "bedrock:InvokeModel",
        "bedrock:ListFoundationModels"
      ],

        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

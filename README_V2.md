## 🎯 What is BCCE?

BCCE (Bedrock Claude Code Enablement Kit) is the **AWS-native enterprise governance layer** that makes any AI workflow engine ready for Fortune 500 deployment.

**Not another workflow engine** - but the essential enterprise infrastructure that provides:

- **🏛️ Enterprise Governance**: Policy enforcement, approval workflows, compliance frameworks
- **💰 Cost Intelligence**: Advanced cost optimization, budgeting, and chargeback
- **📋 Compliance Logging**: Audit-grade session recording for regulatory requirements
- **🔗 Enterprise Integration**: Connect AI workflows to Slack, Jira, ServiceNow, and more
- **☁️ AWS Native**: Deep integration with AWS enterprise services

## 🤔 Why BCCE?

### The Enterprise AI Workflow Challenge

Organizations want to use AI workflow tools like Claude Code and Shopify Roast, but they need:

| Enterprise Need | Existing Solutions | BCCE Solution |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Policy Enforcement** | ❌ Individual developer controls | ✅ Organization-wide governance |
| **Cost Management** | ❌ Basic usage tracking | ✅ Advanced cost intelligence |
| **Compliance Auditing** | ❌ Limited audit trails | ✅ Comprehensive session recording |
| **Enterprise Integration** | ❌ Basic GitHub/Git integration | ✅ Full enterprise system integration |
| **AWS Integration** | ❌ Generic cloud support | ✅ Deep AWS-native integration |

### BCCE's Unique Position

**Claude Code**: Excellent AI-native workflows, limited enterprise governance  
**Shopify Roast**: Elegant workflow orchestration, no AWS/enterprise focus  
**BCCE**: Enterprise governance layer that works with both + more

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- AWS account with Bedrock access
- One or more AI workflow engines (Claude Code, Roast, etc.)
- Node.js 18+ for BCCE CLI

### 5-Minute Setup

```bash
# 1. Install BCCE
npm install -g @aws/bcce

# 2. Configure AWS and policies
bcce setup

# 3. Run health check
bcce doctor

# 4. Execute workflow with governance
bcce workflow run security-review.yml --engine=claude_code
```

### Your First Governed Workflow

```yaml
# security-review.yml
workflow: "Security Review with Approval"
engine: claude_code

governance:
  policies: ["security", "cost-control"]
  approval_required: true
  compliance_logging: true

steps:
  - security_scan
  - vulnerability_analysis
  - remediation_recommendations
```

Execute with governance:
```bash
bcce workflow run security-review.yml
```

## 🎯 Core Features

### 1. **Enterprise Policy Management**

Define organization-wide policies that apply to any workflow engine:

```yaml
# Enterprise policies
security:
  sensitive_data_blocking: true
  security_review_required: true
  approved_models: ["claude-3-5-sonnet"]

cost:
  monthly_budget_per_user: 500.00
  auto_throttle_threshold: 120%

compliance:
  session_recording: "full"
  audit_retention: "7_years"
  encryption_required: true
```

### 2. **Advanced Cost Intelligence**

```bash
# Get cost insights
bcce cost analysis --period 30d
# Monthly spend: $2,847
# Top cost drivers: Complex workflows (67%), Model selection (23%)
# Optimization potential: 34% savings available

# Optimize automatically
bcce cost optimize --auto-apply
# ✅ Routed 127 simple tasks to Haiku (saving $156/month)
# ✅ Set budget alerts at 80% threshold
# ✅ Enabled automatic throttling
```

### 3. **Multi-Stage Approval Workflows**

```yaml
# Approval workflow for security findings
approval_workflow:
  trigger: security_findings_detected
  stages:
    - reviewer: security_team
      sla: 4_hours
    - reviewer: engineering_manager
      condition: critical_findings
    - reviewer: ciso
      condition: cost > 1000
```

### 4. **Compliance-Grade Audit Trails**

```bash
# Search audit logs
bcce audit search "security review" --timeframe=30d
# Found 47 security reviews
# All sessions recorded with full context
# Compliance status: ✅ SOC2 ready

# Generate compliance report
bcce audit report --framework=soc2 --period=quarterly
```

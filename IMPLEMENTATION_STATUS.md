## üîç Implementation Details

### Phase 2 Technical Achievements

#### Multi-Tool Analytics Architecture
The multi-tool intelligence framework provides unified analytics across AI coding tools:

```typescript
// Core analytics collection
const metrics = await multiToolIntelligence.collectMetrics(period);

// Productivity correlation analysis
const teamMetrics = correlationEngine.calculateTeamMetrics(metrics.tools);
const correlations = correlationEngine.analyzeProductivityCorrelations(metrics.tools);

// AI-powered recommendations
const recommendations = correlationEngine.generateOptimizationRecommendations(
  correlations, benchmarks
);
```

#### Enterprise Security Integration
The contractor management system provides comprehensive access control:

```typescript
// Contractor provisioning with policies
const grant = await contractorManager.provisionAccess(contractorId, requestedBy);

// Real-time access validation
const validation = await contractorManager.validateAccess(
  contractorId, 'workflow-run', { workflowId, cost }
);

// Security monitoring and alerts
contractorManager.on('security-alert', (alert) => {
  // Automated security response
});
```

### Cost Tracking Integration
The cost intelligence engine seamlessly integrates with the existing workflow runner:

```typescript
// In WorkflowRunner.executeAgentStep()
const costMetrics = await costEngine.trackUsage(
  { prompt: transcript, model: workflow.model },
  { usage: { input_tokens: inputTokens, output_tokens: outputTokens } },
  { workflowId, stepId, team, project }
);

// Real-time cost display
console.log(`üí∞ Step cost: $${costMetrics.totalCost.toFixed(4)}`);
```
